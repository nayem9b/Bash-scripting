When we deploy k8s, we have clusters

Two important parts are:
* Master (control plane)
* Worker Nodes

Nodes(Minions) == Server == VPC
Cluster = Group of Nodes == Node + Node + Node

Master has API Server which are connected to Kubelet of worker nodes. Kubelets are Worker Node agents.

Containers are inside the pod. 
Pod: A single instance of a running process in a cluster. Pod is the smallest unit. It can run one or more containers and share the same resources

Components of Master Node:
 * API SERVER= Kubectl
 * Schedular = Assign node to newly created pods
 * ETCD = key value store, having all cluster data
 * Control Manager = responsible for managing the state of the cluster

Components of Worker Nodes:
 * Kubelet = Agent, make sure conatiners running in pods
 * Pod = Container run in a Pod
 * Kube-proxy = Maintains network rules for communication with pods
 * Container-runtime =  A tool responsible for running containers
